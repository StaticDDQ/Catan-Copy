# Catan-Copy
Copy of Catan
A side project that I made of a game based directly on the board game, Catan. The game was made using the Unity engine in a Lightweight Render Pipeline which utilizes the Photon API for multiplayer features. 

So far all features have been completed, some development cards need to be added in the future and UI must be improved as well. All textures are taken from lunarground.com temporarily as I will create my own textures in the future.

Development cards so far:
- Knight
- Victory point
